It is a felony under United States federal law for any newsmagazine over two years old not to have an accompanying podcast. Our magazine recently hit its two-year anniversary, so we’re pleased to announce… Current Affairs: The Podcast.<br>

Every other week our editorial team brings you a mixture of discussion, analysis, and whimsy. From the Current Affairs World Headquarters to your ear, our podcast is a refreshing alternative to the stale and tedious audio products to which you have grudgingly become accustomed. We’re cutting through the nonsense, bursting open ideological piñatas, and presenting a friendly, relaxed, and upbeat guide to the world of politics.<br>
